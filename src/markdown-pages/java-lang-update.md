Java finally gets updates that can bring it closer to nowadays trends. New version should become an LTS very soon!

JDK 21 will also bring finalized virtual threads, which are lightweight threads that hold great promise for dramatically reducing the challenges of writing, maintaining, and observing high-throughput concurrent applications. The objectives behind this feature include enabling server applications to scale effectively with optimal hardware utilization, promoting the adoption of virtual threads with minimal changes to the existing lang.

Thread API code, and simplifying virtual threads' debugging and profiling with current JDK tools. JDK 21 will ensure complete support for thread-local variables with virtual threads, boosting compatibility with existing libraries and aiding the migration of task-based code to use virtual threads.
