It has many benefits: React.js and Next.js compatibility, opt-in optimizing compiler and more. Check [Milion.js] at https://dev.to/aidenybai/unleashing-millionjs-v200-2f96.

Million.js can run on the same React API you know and love but uses a hyper-optimized virtual DOM. It's one of the top performers in the JS Framework Benchmark comparing to the best techs.

Up to 70% faster than React. Integrated and shipped fast.
No need to learn a new framework. Works with your existing React components.

Block Virtual DOM: Million.js introduces a novel "block" virtual DOM.
